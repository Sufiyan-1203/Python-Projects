# Directory Path Generator

## Overview
This Python script generates and prints a visual tree structure of any directory you specify. It displays the folder and file hierarchy in a format similar to the Unix `tree` command.

## Features
- Visualizes the directory structure with clear indentation and tree branches.
- Recursively lists all files and subdirectories.
- Handles non-existent paths gracefully.

## How to Run

1. Make sure you have Python 3 installed.
2. Place `path_final.py` in your working directory.
3. Run the script: python path_final.py
4. When prompted, enter the full path of the directory you want to visualize.

## Example Output
    Enter the directory path: C:\Users\SUFIYAN\Documents
    ├── file1.txt
    ├── file2.txt
    └── Subfolder
        ├── subfile1.txt
        └── subfile2.txt
